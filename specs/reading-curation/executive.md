# Reading Curation System - Executive Summary

## Requirements Summary

The Reading Curation System solves decision fatigue for busy technical
professionals by automating content discovery and filtering. Users receive
articles from three sources: email newsletters (handling paywalled content like
Matt Levine and Substacks), RSS feeds (for blogs without email options), and
manual URL submission via iOS Shortcuts share sheet. Each article is
automatically scored 1-10 by Claude with reasoning visible, reducing daily
curation time from 20 minutes to under 5 minutes. Users browse a score-sorted
inbox showing only high-value articles by default, select what interests them,
and download bundles as individual text files for transfer to e-reader devices.
The system tracks reading decisions to provide precision and recall metrics,
helping users tune scoring prompts over time. In-app reading and full-text
search across archives support reference lookups. Security defaults to HTTP
Basic Auth with randomly generated credentials, with explicit opt-out required
for unauthenticated access.

## Technical Summary

Self-hosted FastAPI service on Python 3.12+ with three ingestion paths: IMAP
monitoring for email newsletters with HTML-to-Markdown conversion, polite RSS
polling via feedparser respecting robots.txt with 1-5 second delays, and API
endpoint for iOS Shortcuts integration. Content extraction uses readability-lxml
with manual review flags for failures. Anthropic SDK scores each article with
versioned prompts, storing prompt IDs alongside scores to enable re-scoring
after prompt changes. SQLite database stores articles, scores, and reading
decisions. Frontend displays score-sorted article inbox with LLM reasoning,
filtering via Pydantic v2 validated queries, and selection controls. Bundle
generation creates individual text files per article including metadata.
Statistics dashboard calculates precision (percentage of sent articles actually
read) and recall (percentage of read articles that were auto-recommended) over
time. Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth by default with random credential
generation logged at startup, plus optional API key for programmatic access via
environment variable, with explicit dangerous mode flag required to disable
security. Development environment uses uv for package management, PEP 723 dev.py
for task automation, strict type checking via mypy and pyright, Ruff for linting
and formatting, and pytest with hypothesis for property-based testing. Async
HTTP operations via httpx. Source code follows src/ layout pattern.
